\section{Introduction}
This document is intended for developers of \xdb{}, as well as people who are interested in the mechanics of the database application.
It will provide detailed insight into the ways the application was designed, and how to leverage and understand them.

The database is fully written in Go.
In some places, we used assembler code to improve performance, however, there will always be Go code as a fallback, which will have the same (tested) functionality as the assembler implementation.

\textbf{Please note that we are not going to talk about basic features of Go. If you are reading this document, we already assume, that you have good knowledge and quite a bit of experience with Go.}
